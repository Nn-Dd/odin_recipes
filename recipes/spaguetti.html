    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Carbonara is a pasta dish made with eggs, hard cheese,
        cured pork, and black pepper. The dish took its modern
        form and name in the middle of the 20th century.
        The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, parmesan,
        or a combination of the two.
